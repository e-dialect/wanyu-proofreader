"""Fail when the suite files, suites.json and the CI/docs lists drift apart.

The matrix used to live only inside ci.yml, so CONTRIBUTING.md listed four
suites while CI ran eleven. Adding a suite file now requires registering it, and
every coverage claim below is read out of the parsed workflow's `run:` steps and
the `env:` that feeds them, rather than matched against the file as text — so
deleting a job, leaving the job's name behind in a comment, or pinning a matrix
value to a constant can no longer keep this guard green. A step only counts as
feeding a suite when it runs the suite runner itself.
